## About <a name = "about"></a>

Poka is a text-based game of poker. I hope to continue this as a project during quarantine.

## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

Just run `main_loop.py` with Python to run the game.

### Prerequisites

You only need Python (preferably newer versions than 3.7.2) to interpret and run this game.

## Progress <a name = "prog"></a>

* ~~Bare minimum to run correctly~~
* Minimum viable product
* I am satisfied (will never be checked off)
* Multiple gamemodes

### To-Do <a name = "todo"></a>

1. More of the game loop.
2. Automatic hand detection.
3. More game types than just Hold'Em (which is boring.)
